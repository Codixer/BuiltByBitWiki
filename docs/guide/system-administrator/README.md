## What is in their job role?

A system administrator (sysadmin) is an IT professional who supports both single and multiple computing environments and ensures continuous, optimal performance of IT services and support systems. They are responsible for basically "keeping the lights on" to limit work disruptions. This includes system maintenance and configuration, installation of hardware and software and troubleshooting problems when they arise.

## Are we developers?
Unfortunately no, we are generally not a developer, unless we sell those services seperately. We don't deal with code often unless it is involved with our tasks (Example creating bash scripts)

Bare in mind that the bullet points below aren't conclusive of all the tasks these roles carry out. Make sure you don't get the two mixed up when looking for something to be made versus getting a server configured with a game panel for example.
:::

A system admin "administrates".
 * We install the software so it's operational and accessible.
 * We configure the system so backups are in place.
 * We protect the server using firewalls to prevent malicious attacks.

A system developer "develops".
 * We create the software for users to use on a daily basis.
 * We design the code to make it work on the system.
 * We secure our programs with the relevant security tools.
