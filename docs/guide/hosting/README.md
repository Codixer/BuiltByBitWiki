# How you should NOT start a hosting!
This is one of the more sensative subjects. To explain, the (minecraft) hosting market is filled with a CRAP TON of hosting companies, from hosting companies that are managed interantionally to companies that host a server out of their own home. If you are thinking of starting your own, there are a few things to think about **before** you even think about beginning with your own hosting company. 

These are: 
 - Do you have a list of clients interested in getting your hosting?
 - Is there are reason people should go to you, and not someone else?
 - Are you willing to loose money at first? Because machines aren't cheap.
 - Do you have the expertise to start a hosting, or are you able to (properly) hire someone to do so?

If you responded yes to at least the questions above, you should think about the following as well:
 - Where does your intrest lay in. Earning some quick money, or starting an actual bussiness?
 - Do you have the the time and experience required to help people?
 - How do you plan to create your websites? Are they handcoded, templated, or bought from other people?
 - What type of hardware are you planning to work with?
 - What makes you different from competitors? 
 - Is the amount of money you have to spend for it worth it? Example (Not accurate pricing):
   - 1 Dedicated Server (128gb ram, AMD Ryzen CPU): ~122$/month
   - WHMCS License (Depending on your budget between $18.95-$44.95/month)
   - System Administrators ($50-$300+/month)
   - Backup/Secondary Locations? (Another ~122$/month)
   - Cloudflare (~45$/month, or free. Depending on the plan used)
   - Support Staff (Want to go for volunteering? Or do you plan to pay your staff? Depending on the chosen route your staff may or may not help you throughout the entire journey)
   - Monitoring Solutions (You would possibly want to be notified if your systems go down, )
   - Getting a brand (website/main page/shop) made, possible logo's, and other marketing/relations (20$-2000$ One-Time/Monthly)
   - Marketing on other websites, maybe google ads. Or what about buying a spot on BBB'd sidebar? (10$-1000$/Week (Yes, per week)) 
 - Do you have the sales experience, or are you able to make smart descisions? 

Those questions are thinks you will have to think about before starting a hosting company. Starting a host isn't cheap, especially when you have never worked with any sorts of hardware like this. Or if you have just begun to think about starting your own company. 

In some countries, there are also a ton of laws regarding Taxes, buisiness registrations (The Netherlands has the "KVK" for example, which is Chamber of Commerce in other countries), your country may have some legal requirements that you have to uphold. Or if you sell in the EU, you may have to have EU specific servers. As per the GPDR, there are requirements to data having to be hosted in the same country it's being obtained from.

# Which route should I go?
Depending on what you're going to sell, you should go with WHMCS as your billing panel. It's a really popular billing solution, supporting many integrations such as DirectAdmin, Pterodactyl, SolusVM, Virtualizor, etc. This is really useful to automate your hosting.
